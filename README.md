# Valkyrie
A web-app with tools for Valkyrie Crusade made with Angular.js and some other stuff.

https://valkyrie.nekuro.com

Some stuff might not work as expected since it's been made pretty hastily and angular is new to me.
This also means the code is not pretty or optimized, don't hate me.

## Current features 
#### Main
* Resource building monitor
* Half working experience calculator/upgrade helper

#### Extras
* Can run offline, just download the website locally.
* Made to support phones responsively
* 'Add to homescreen' support for chrome android, makes it feel like a native app.

## Possible planned features
This isn't in any particular order.
* Some kind of authentication for server side data storing
  * So you can have your monitor synced
* A page for help with finding alliance members/comrades
  * With personal page for:
    * type of alliance
    * requirements
    * spots available
    * activity
* finding the nearest pizza hut

## Disclaimer
This is made using angular.js and other tools I never used before, so stuff might break at any time as I'm trying stuff out.
Also made in my free time.
